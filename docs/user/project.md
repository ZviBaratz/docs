# Project

*Project* is where you can organize your dataset, do data processing, and share them with your project members.

Each project can have specific set of users for `admins`, `members`, or `guests` groups. `Admin` can update the project access policy, and edit `admins` and `members` of the project. `Members` has read/write access to the content of the project, such as datasets, and projects, but can not make changes to the group members. `Guests` will have read access to the datasets and processes. 

Brainlife currently supports the following project access policies.

* **Public**

    Public project allows anyone registered on Brainlife (not just a member of the project) to download and use archived datasets to process data. All users can view all public projects on Brainlife under project list.

* **Private**

    Private project allows only the project members to download, or use archived datasets to process data. Only the admins and project members can find the project under project list.

* **Protected**

    Same as Private projects except all users can see basic project details. You can use this to keep your project private but solicit other users to join the project or become a guest users to have read access to the datasets.

The following table shows who can perform which actions under project.
