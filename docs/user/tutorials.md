This page introduces a series of commonly used steps for data processing. 

# Diffusion-weighted MRI, Tractography and Tractometry.
## TractSeg Diffusion Processing
This pipeline combines processing proposed by Wasserthal et al., Neuroimage (2018).

## Ensemble tractography Single-Shell Diffusion and Tractography Processing
This pipeline combines processing proposed by Caiafa and Pestilli, Scientific Reports (2017) and Takemura et al., PLoS Computational Biology (2016).

## Ensemble tractography Multishell Diffusion Processing using DESIGNER
This pipeline combines processing proposed by Ades-Aron et al., Neuroimage (2018) and Takemura et al., PLoS Computational Biology (2016).
