# Datatypes

As you learned in [Getting Started](https://brainlife.io/docs/user/started/#brainlifeio-terms-to-know), brainlife.io Apps exchange data through `datatypes`. We are now going to cover datatypes in-depth in this section -- you can check out all of the brainlife.io [datatpyes here](https://brainlife.io/docs/user/datatypes/).

The screenshot below shows you a datatype. Each datatype consists of a `name`, `description`, and a list of `files` that define the datatype's structure.

The example below shows the datatype definition for the [neuro/life datatype](https://brainlife.io/datatype/58d15eaee13a50849b258844):

```json
{
    "name" : "neuro/life",
    "desc" : "LiFE Output (fe structure)",
    "files" : [ 
        {
            "id" : "fe",
            "filename" : "output_fe.mat",
            "desc" : "FE structure",
            "ext" : ".mat",
            "required" : true
        }, 
        {
            "id" : "life_results",
            "filename" : "life_results.json",
            "required" : true
        }, 
        {
            "id" : "tracts",
            "dirname" : "tracts",
            "required" : true
        }
    ]
}
```

In this example, the [brainlife/app-life](https://brainlife.io/app/5baa44b1d0be8b002776b8f7) App generates a dataset with this datatype. Other Apps that want to use the `neuro/life` output can request to have the files made available to their Apps with the brainlife.io [App registration form](https://brainlife.io/docs/apps/register/).

It is important to note that it is up to the developers to exchange the dataset to create well-documented file contents, and they should consider that thorough documentation benefits other brainlife.io users. App developers can discuss the structure of the datatype and what each file means in the `#datatype` channel of [brainlife.io's Slack workspace](https://brainlife-inviter.herokuapp.com/).

_Quick Note:_ While a datatype might sound similar to a [BIDS specification](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), brainlife.io datatypes differ in that they:

* Mainly concern data derivatives generated by Apps and are used only by Apps exchanging those datasets

* Are only used within the brainlife.io platform and are not meant to become standards for a particular data format 

* Are defined by App developers involved in exchanging input/output datasets, not by brainlife.io platform developers

## Datatype Tags

Sometimes you want to be more specific about the type of dataset for a particular datatype. For example, [neuro/anat/t1w](https://brainlife.io/datatype/58c33bcee13a50849b25879a) could be ACPC aligned or not and [neuro/dwi](https://brainlife.io/datatype/58c33c5fe13a50849b25879b) could be single-shell or multi-shell. brainlife.io allows you to specify each datatype with **datatype tags**. 

You should only use this tag to specify the information on datasets, not generalize it. For example, we don't have "multi-shell" datatype tags because `neuro/dwi` is by default "multi-shell" data. While it is normal to have different b-values in a `dwi.bvals` file, "single-shell" is a special case for the `neuro/dwi` datatype where b-values happens to all be the same number -- so we added the "single-shell" tag to describe it.

Since datatype tags add specificity, brainlife.io can correctly identify which datasets can be used for which Apps by examining a dataset's datatype tags and an App's input dataset tags. But do not confuse a *datatype* tag with *dataset* tag!

* A *datatype* tag can only be set by the App developer. It is part of the datatype and cannot be modified once the dataset is created. 

* A *dataset* tag, on the other hand, is a tag that can be freely edited by any user, and it allows for easier searching or bulk processing of datasets.
