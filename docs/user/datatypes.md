# Datatypes

> Please read [Tutorial / Datatypes](/user/tutorial/#datatypes) first.

Brainlife Apps exchange data through `datatypes`.

![resources](/img/datatypes.png)

Each datatype consists of `name`, `description`, and a list of files (or directories) that define the overall structure of the datatype. 

For example, the following is a datatype definition for `neuro/life` datatype.

```json
{
    "name" : "neuro/life",
    "desc" : "LiFE Output (fe structure)",
    "files" : [ 
        {
            "id" : "fe",
            "filename" : "output_fe.mat",
            "desc" : "FE structure",
            "ext" : ".mat",
            "required" : true
        }, 
        {
            "id" : "life_results",
            "filename" : "life_results.json",
            "required" : true
        }, 
        {
            "id" : "tracts",
            "dirname" : "tracts",
            "required" : true
        }
    ]
}
```

For this example datatype, `brain-life/app-life` App generates a dataset with this datatype, and other Apps that want to use `neuro/life` output can request to have those files made available to their Apps by registering them on Brainlife App registration form. (Please read [Registering App](/apps/register/) page for more info). The actual content/semantics of each file are up to developers exchanging the dataset to decide, and it should be well documented as part of the datatype registration process.

Please see other datatypes defined in [brain-life/datatypes](https://github.com/brain-life/datatypes/tree/master/datatypes).

Brainlife datatype might sound similar to BIDS specification, but it differs in following areas.

* Brainlife datatypes mainly concern data derivatives generated by Apps and used only by Apps exchanging those datasets. They are only used within Brainlife platform and not meant to become standards for that particular data format.

* Brainlife datatypes are defined by App developers involved in exchanging input/output datasets, not by Brainlife platform developers. App developers should discuss and agree on the structure of the datatype and what each file means. They can submit an issue on [brain-life/datatypes](https://github.com/brain-life/datatypes/issues) and/or submit a pull request containing the list of files/directories to be registered on Brainlife.
