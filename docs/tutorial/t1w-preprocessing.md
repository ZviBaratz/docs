## Anatomical (T1w) preprocessing.

This page highlights the most common steps used to preprocess anatomical magentic resonance imaging data (T1-weighted or T1w) on brainlife.io The goal of this pipeline is to process anatomical data for successive analyses â€“ volumetric analyses from T1w meausres, combination of T1w and diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) or functional neuroimaging data (fMRI). pipelines. This pipelines combines functions from FSL, Automatic Registration Toolbox (ART), and Freesurfer.

This tutorial will use a combination of skills developed in the introduction-to-brainlife tutorial (). If you have not read this, or you are not comfortable staging, processing, archiving and viewing data on brainlife.io, please go back and follow that tutorial before beginning this one.

### 1. Set the orientation of the brain.

The first step is to make sure the anatomy of the brain 'looks right.' This means that the coordinate system for the T1w image is stored rotated such that the brain appears up-right and centered when opened in the major visualization toolboxes that the scientific community uses (i.e., generally we look at images where the nose faces towards right-hand side in the sagittal plane, and forward in the axial and coronal planes). This rotation involves changing information in the T1w data files and headers. Beside agreeing to the standard convetions, this orientation is important because it assures that the data inside the T1w iamges will be "indexed,"  or read, appropirately allowing different software libraries for neuroimaging data analysis to  read the data, interpret the position and dimensions of individual three-dimensional pixels (i.e., voxels). During this process oftentimes the neck is removed from the original MRI data, so to fit the image within an adequate volume.

The best [brainlife.io](https://brainlife.io) app to perform this task is:

| ![crop-reorient](/docs/img/app.crop-reorient.bl.header.png)|
|------------------------------------|
| https://doi.org/10.25663/bl.app.15 |

For this tutorial, we will use this app to crop and reorient the anatomical (T1w) image.

To perform crop & reorientation of the raw anatomical (T1w) image, follow the following steps:

1. Go to the 'Archives' page of your project by clicking the 'Archives' tab on your Projects page.
1. Select the raw (i.e. untouched) neuro/anat/t1w datatype by clicking the box next to the dataset.
1. Click the 'Stage to process'
    * For Project, make sure your project is selected
    * For Process, select 'Create New Process'
    * For Description, name the process 'Anatomical Preprocessing'
    * Hit 'OK'
1. On the 'Process' tab, click 'Submit App' to submit a new application.
    * In the search bar, type 'Crop and Reorient T1'.
    * Click the app card.
1. On the 'Submit App' page, select the following:
    * For input, select the staged raw anatomical (T1w) image by clicking the drop-down menu and finding the appropriate dataset.
    * Select the boxes for 'reorient' and 'crop'
    * Select the box for 'Archive all output datasets when finished
        * For 'Dataset Tags', type and enter 'crop_reorient'
    * Hit 'Submit'
1. Once the app is finished running, view the results by clicking the 'eye' icon to the right of the dataset
    * Choose 'fsleyes' as your viewer

If you're happy with the results, then you're ready to move onto the next step: ACPC alignment!

### 2. Anterior Commissure - Posterior Comissure (ACPC) alignment.

The next step is to align the anatomical image to the point where two white matter tracts cross hemispheres: the anterior commissure and posterior commissure (ACPC). The anterior commissure connects the two temporal lobes and is located below the anterior portion of the corpus callosum (i.e. fornix), the large white matter tract connecting the two hemispheres. The posterior commissure is located just behind the cerebral aqueduct, an important connection between the third and fourth ventricles. This step will move the image in a way that effectively "centers" the image. Specifically, the image will be moved so that a horizontal line drawn from the front to the back of the brain will pass through both landmarks, and a horizontal line drawn from the temporal lobes and a vertical line from the top of the brain to the bottom bisect at the midpoint of the two landmarks. A majority of the following processing steps require the anatomical image to be aligned to the ACPC plane, including Freesurfer parcellation. There are two different apps to perform this step: one using the Automatic Registration Toolbox (ART), the other using FSL and the Human Connectome Project (HCP) preprocessing pipeline. We recommend using the HCP-based app as it is more modern and generally performs better than ART.

[brainlife.io](https://brainlife.io) provides apps that can be run on raw T1w to align the image to the ACPC plane automatically. One is from the Automated Registration Toolbox (art):

    * Click the app card.
1. On the 'Submit App' page, select the following:
    * For input, select the cropped and reoriented anatomical (T1w) image by clicking the drop-down menu and finding the appropriate dataset (look for the datatag 'crop_reorient'.
    * For 'template', choose the 'MNI152_1MM' template from the drop-down menu.
    * For 'reorient', deselect this box as we have already reoriented the image.
    * Select the box for 'Archive all output datasets when finished
        * For 'Dataset Tags', type and enter 'acpc_aligned'
    * Hit 'Submit'
1. Once the app is finished running, view the results by clicking the 'eye' icon to the right of the dataset
    * Choose 'fsleyes' as your viewer

If you're happy with the results, then you're ready to move onto the next step: Freesurfer parcellation!

### 3. Freesurfer Brain Parcellation.

The next step is perform anatomical preprocessing and divide (i.e. parcellate) the brain into different regions and tissue types (i.e. white matter, gray matter) using Freesurfer. These regions represent different gray matter (i.e. cortical) landmarks such as the motor and somatosensory cortices, and are typically derived from histological properties of these regions. Sometimes, they are derived from functional activation (i.e. fMRI) patterns. Freesurfer will divide the anatomical image into different tissue types (i.e. white matter, gray matter), parcellate the gray matter into known anatomical landmarks, and output statistics regarding the volume and thickness of the different tissue types and anatomical landmarks. These regions are then used for a large number of downstream steps, including white matter tract segmentation. Information regarding the volume and thickness of each region can also be used for group analyses.

If you're happy with the results, then you're ready to move onto the next step: Thalamic nuclei segmentation!

### 4. Thalamic nuclei segmentation.

The next step is segment the multiple regions (i.e. nuclei) of the thalamus, each with it's own distinct functional properties. For more information about the different thalamic nuclei, please see http://freesurfer.net/fswiki/ThalamicNuclei.

The best [brainlife.io](https://brainlife.io) app to perform this task is:

| ![freesurfer](/docs/img/app.thalamic-nuclei.bl.header.png)|
|------------------------------------|
| https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.222 |

For this tutorial, we will use the Segment thalamic nuclei application.

To segment the thalamus from the Freesurfer parcellation, follow the following steps:
1. From the same process you used for Step 1 (crop and reorient), Step 2 (ACPC alignment), & Step 3 (Freesurfer parcellation), click 'Submit App' to submit a new application.
    * In the search bar, type 'Segment thalamic nuclei'.
    * Click the app card.

    * Select the box for 'Archive all output datasets when finished
        * For 'Dataset Tags', type and enter 'thalamic_nuclei'
    * Hit 'Submit'
1. Once the app is finished running, view the results by clicking the 'eye' icon to the right of the dataset
    * Choose 'freeview' as your viewer.
    * In freeview, perform the following actions to view the thalamic nuclei:
        * Deselect all of the Volumes and Surfaces on the left control panel by clicking the box next to each image. Leave the 'T1' image selected
        * In the top left corner, click 'File --> Load volume'
            * For 'Select volume file', click the 'file' icon to the right of the drop-down menu
                * Select the image 'ThalamicNuclei.v10.T1.FSvoxelSpace.mgz'.
            * Click 'Load'
            * Click 'OK'
        * You won't be able to view each segmented nuclei, but you can click on the image and scroll over the white area. In the 'Cursor' bar at the bottom of the screen, you'll see a field titled 'ThalamicNuclei.v10.T1.FSvoxelSpace' with a number by it. Those numbers are representative of the different thalamic nuclei. We will update the viewer in the next few weeks to be able to view the different thalamic nuclei!

If you're happy with the results, then you're ready to move onto the next step: Atlas transfer!


### 5. Atlas transfer.

The next step in the anatomical preprocessing (T1w) pipeline is to fit different parcellations to the Freesufer-generated parcellation. This is useful as new parcellations come out relatively frequently, each generated based on different histological or functional properties. We recommend mapping the Glasser-derived 180 node parcellation, as it was derived from both histological and functional properties (Glasser MF, Coalson TS, Robinson EC, et al. A multi-modal parcellation of human cerebral cortex. Nature. 2016;536(7615):171â€“178. doi:10.1038/nature18933).

| ![matt](/docs/img/app.matt.bl.header.png)|
|------------------------------------|
| https://doi.org/10.25663/bl.app.23 |

To transfer the Glasser 180 node parcellation to our subject's Freesurfer parcellation, follow the following steps:
1. From the same process you used for Step 1 (crop and reorient), Step 2 (ACPC alignment), Step 3 (Freesurfer) & Step 4 (Thalamic nuclei segmentation), click 'Submit App' to submit a new application.
    * In the search bar, type 'Multi-Atlas Transfer Tool'.
    * Click the app card.
1. On the 'Submit App' page, select the following:
    * For input, select the Thalamic nuclei Freesurfer output generated in Step 4 (Thalamic nuclei segmentation).
    * For 'atlas', choose 'hcp-mmp-b' from the drop-down menu. This is the Glasser 180 node parcellation
    * Select the box for 'Archive all output datasets when finished
        * For 'Dataset Tags', type and enter 'glasser'
    * Hit 'Submit'

Unfortunately, there's currently no viewer set up to review the results of this atlas transfer. However, if your Freesurfer parcellation looks good, then the transfer of the Glasser atlas should also be just fine!

You are now ready to move onto the final step: tissue-type mask segmentation!


### 6. Tissue-type mask segmentation.

The next step is perform separate the anatomical image into multiple tissue-type (5tt) components. These tissue types include Gray Matter (GM; neuronal somas), White Matter (WM; myelinated axons), and Cerebro-spinal Fluid (CSF). Separating these tissue types is important as it will allow us to perform more anatomically-accurate tractography and allow us to analyze the properties of specific tissues.
