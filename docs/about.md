# What is Brainlife?

A modern platform based that uses cloud and high-performance computing systems to support reproducible analyses, data visualization, data management. Brainlife also provide a unique mechanism to publish all research assets associated with a scientific project (data and analyses) embedded in a cloud computing environment and referenced by a single digital-object-identifier (DOI). The platform is unique because of its focus on supporting scientific reproducibility beyond open code and open data, by providing fundamental smart mechanisms for what we refer to as “Open Services.” 

# Brainlife Apps

Brainlife uses Apps to analyze data. **Apps** are small programs, small modules or compute units, that can b made part of a larger series of steps in a full data analysis workflow for a publication. Brainlife Apps are meant to do a small but meaningful step in a longer analysis pipeline. Apps are modules and the platform allows users to devlop, use, combine, and reuse Apps to simply build complex pipelines for customized brain data analyses. Most Apps indeed do only one thing, they process data in a specific way and are meant to perform a small set of operations and handle small sets of data; they do one thing, they do it well.

Apps can be developed and published on the Brainlife platform by anyone. App developers can be computational neuroscientists, cognitive neuroscientists, but also computer scientists or engineers. Apps are snippets of code implementing algorithms or analyses. By follow a few easy steps code to publish the code on the Brainlife platform as an App. Publishing code as an App allows scientists to use the data and computational resources available through Brainlife. Apps published on Brainlife can be used privately or shared publicly with the platform users community. 

# Brainlife Datatypes

Brainlife Apps communicate via Brain Life “Datatypes.” Once published on Apps can interface with other Apps through the use of Brain Life Datatypes. Datatypes are abstract objects that organize the combination of inputs and outputs files and folders necessary for Apps into a system that allows App communication and interfacing. Datatypes are suggested and by App developers and published as part of the App publishing process. The Brainlife platform can use these Datatypes to allow Apps to be organized into workflows and pipelines. The Brainlife Datatypes are not file types but meta-data types, they ar compatible with BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structures), Freesurfer, NIFTIs, and other similar formats.

# Brainlife Clouds (Compute Resource)

Brainlife allows orchestration of data and computing across mix systems of Clouds and high-performance computing clusters (HPC). We refer to both HCP and CLouds as Brainlife Clouds, techically not precise trminology, but simple. Less is more. Brainlife orchestration allows users and compute resource providers to register a compute resource to make it availablee publicly to the full Brainlife users community or privately to a subset of users. Brainlife has smart mechanisms that allow Apps to run on differnt resources, privately or publicly. With a traditional approach of running an entire workflow on a small set of resources, some part of the workflow might not be optimal to run on a given resource, Brainlife allows App Developers to identify resources that best fit their Apps and score the compute resources available on the Brainlife platform depending on how well they work with the App they develop.
