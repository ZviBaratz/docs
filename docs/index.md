# Brainlife Documentation

Welcome to the Brainlife documentation portal! This site contains up-to-date information about the Brainlife platform. The information is organized based in sections focusing on our different target communities. We envision three primary groups of Brainlife users:

### End Users. 
Neuroscientists, Psychologists and other investigators interested in using Brainlife to run Apps on public or private data to generate scientific insights and publish their results.

### App Developers. 
Computational neuroscientists, computer scientists and statisticians interested in using Brainlife to share their analysis methods and algorithms by developing Apps and making them available on the platform.

### Resource Providers. 
Clusters managers, and cyberinfrastructure managers interested in providing a resource where Brainlife Apps and users can run. 

<!--
* Data Publisher: Users who use Brainlife to publish their datasets for others to use
* Learner: Users who are not familiar with neuroscience and wants to use Brainlife as an educational tool.
